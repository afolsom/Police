Violent-crime categories include rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, and they include threatened, attempted, and completed occurrences of those crimes. Other violent-crime categories in this table, including domestic violence and violent crime involving injury, are not mutually exclusive from these categories or from each other.
