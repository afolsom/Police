"Note: Details may not sum to totals due to rounding. Categories include threatened, attempted, and completed crimes. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) household weighting adjustment was updated for 2017 onward, which decreased the estimated number of households, and the number of households experiencing property crime, by about 8%. As a result, the number of property crimes should not be compared between 2017 or 2018 and 2014, 2015, or 2016. Property crime rates are unaffected by this change. See appendix table 8 for standard errors. See Methodology for details on the change in the household weighting adjustment in the NCVS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
