"Note: National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) and Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program crime rates are calculated differently. UCR crime rates are normally reported per 100,000 persons but were recalculated for this report to align with the reporting of NCVS crime rates. See appendix table 9 for standard errors.",,,,
~Not applicable.,,,,
"a/Includes crimes against persons age 11 or younger, persons who are homeless, persons who are institutionalized, and crimes against commercial establishments. These populations are out of sample for the NCVS.",,,,
b/The NCVS estimate includes sexual assault; the UCR does not. The UCR estimate is based on its revised definition of rape. See Methodology for details on the measurement of rape or sexual assault in the NCVS.,,,,
"c/The UCR defines burglary as forcible entry, unlawful entry where no force is used, or attempted forcible entry of a structure to commit a felony or theft. The NCVS defines burglary as the unlawful or forcible entry or attempted entry of places, including a permanent residence, other residence (e.g., a hotel room or vacation residence), or other structure (e.g., a garage or shed) where there was a completed or attempted theft.",,,,
