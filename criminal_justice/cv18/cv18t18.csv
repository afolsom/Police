"Note: Details may not sum to totals because a household may experience multiple types of crime. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) household weighting adjustment was updated for 2017, which decreased the estimated number of households experiencing property crime by about 8%. As a result, the number of property crimes should not be compared from 2017 or 2018 to 2016, 2015, or 2014. Property crime rates are unaffected by this change. See appendix table 23 for standard errors and appendix table 27 for household populations. See Methodology for details on the change in the household weighting adjustment in the NCVS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
